Welcome To The FG3D /Freedom's Gate Characters)

***** ABOUT DEUCALION & PYRRHA PROJECT *****
********************************************

After "Oscar & Mrs Jones", I am proud to present you my new 3D characters called "Deucalion & Pyrrha". They are divided into two categories: Humans and Creatures.
For Humans Category, I keep the "VIP Morph" family (I created a couple of new characters). I added the "Ethnic Category" (African, Asian, European,ecc) with Blendshapes and Textures. Plus I added the various Blendsapes modification of the body parts, the Visemes and the expressions.
5 LOD Levels (from 33,656 to 5,489 Tris). The skeletal system is all changed (based on Genesis 3 DAZ) so it contains 173 bones.

********************************************
************** GETTING STARTED *************
********************************************

it's all very easy

* Open the demo scene that you will find inside the package

* Start and try first simple animations

* Test the blendshape.

* To better integrate all LOD levels of various hair and cloth models, evaluate the use of FG3D Customizer. https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/76154

* I worked a lot on weight-map and for that there is already a good compatibility between the various game-object. If you want you can still use the alpha-textures that I put in the package. Remember to set the rendering mode of the 3d character  material on "Cutout".

Deucalion's Humans includes features and blendshapes all my other FG-3D male characters and much more.
The face is easily customizable by mixing together 7 different "Vip Morph", 13 "Ethnic Morph", all blendshapes that can change nose, mouth, eyes, etc. and 12 included Albedo Maps (23 Albedo maps with Deucalion Add-ons).

************** COMPATIBILITY ***************
********************************************

Both "Deucalion's Humans" and "Deucalion's Creatures" are based on DAZ Genesis 3, so all DAZ Genesis 3 cloth and hair models will be compatible with Deucalion.
Obviously, this compatibility is reduced when body and head morphs are used. If you want, you can use my cloth and hair models that are always 100%


********************************************
************* ABOUT LOD VERSION ************
********************************************

LOD levels are five. In particular I want to point out the care I've worked on with LOD1 level (actually it has a 25% reduction in the number of polygons). It should be considered as a LOD0 B version and you can be used it in most cases unless you want the very first framing plans.

********************************************
************* ABOUT RDX VERSION ************
********************************************

One of the most common ways to hide body parts covered by cloth models is to use masks through Alpha Textures. However, this method does not reduce the number of polygons used. I then thought of a reduced version called "RDX" that can be used in combination with almost all of the "Full Body" cloth models. This is the comparison between the various LOD levels:

LOD0 from 33,656 to 19,000 tris
LOD1 from 25,242 to 14,250 tris
LOD2 from 16,827 to 09,449 tris
LOD3 from 10,673 to 06,120 tris
LOD4 from 05,489 to 03,059 tris

Remember, this reduced version is not included in this package. You can find it in the Deucalion Add-ons package.

********************************************
************ DEUCALION ADD-ONS ************
********************************************

Deucalion's Humans and Deucalion's Creatures are offered free of charge. What are their limits?
Deucalion's Humans:
Only a part of the maps/textures is included in this package.
The included cloth model called Wagsuit has only LOD0 level
Deucalion's Creatures:
Only a part of the maps/textures is included in this package.

To complete this project, you can purchase the Deucalion Add-ons package that includes all missing and extra parts and has a special version of Deucalion's Humans that can be used in conjunction with the "Full Body" cloth models. This special version drastically reduces the number of polygons used.
Everyone who has bought "FG3D Oscar" package can enjoy an upgrade price.
